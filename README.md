# File-movement-and-collation
### python for file movement and collation (moving files out of multiple overlapping folders, or moving a layer of folders out)
You can perform these actions by running two exe files directly: 
* Recursively copy all the files in one folder to a new folder. This helps you move files quickly out of an extremely complex (often multiple folder nesting) 
* Moving all folders in the form of folders within the specified path one level out helps you untangle some of the nested folders and enhances the readability of the file
##### Please note that not all of the code is written, you may need to consult the code in the file_col.py file and modify it yourself when you need to perform some of the features
